\section{Related Work}
Conley et al.~\cite{conley2013does} did a research on which machine learning method is the best for data game results.
However, they only focus on two machine learning approaches, linear regression and k-nearest neighbour(kNN).
In our paper, we focus on four mainstream machine learning approaches.
Kalyannaraman~\cite{kau2013win} did an augmented algorithm on traditional linear regression considering pair relationships of heroes.
However, he did not consider all the relationship between heroes, like the restraint relationship between heroes.
In our research, we further consider the negative relationship of heroes and the time factor.
What's more, the data scale used in our research is much professional and larger than theirs.
It ensures that our research is more reliable and trusted.

Drachen et al. ~\cite{drachen2014skill} try to predict the temporal and spatial of players in the game based on the hero skills.
Semenov et al. ~\cite{semenovapplications} conclude the current research situation for Dota prediction
and show some opinoins of eSports game prediction.
