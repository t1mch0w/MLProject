\section{Problem Description}
This problem is not only a simple estimation of some electronic games,
but also a prediction for people activities.
The practical world is very complex and versatile.
Plenty of immeasurable and unavoidable factors contribute to the results.
Gamerâ€™s skills, physical and emotional condition and the external environment all play important roles,
but none of them can be quantified.
Our prediction system will exclude these uncertain factors to simplify the problem.
